#### Include API Client

Before we can make any requests to create or sign-in any users, we must connect the WeDeploy Android API Client.

To do this, go to `tutorial-email-android/app/tutorial-email-android/app/build.gradle` and include this line inside the dependencies function of this file:

```text/x-groovy
compile 'com.wedeploy:com.wedeploy.android:beta-20170505'
```

After doing this, you have to sync the project, after a seconds you will see that the project is built correctly.
